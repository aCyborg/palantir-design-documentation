This document should review the questions we want to answer during the discovery.

This should help us frame and pinpoint things that are related to strategy like:
* What does success mean to the client?
* Who are the important stakeholders?
* What are the main goals for the site?
* What are key conversions for the site?
* Who uses the site, what are they like, what do they want?
